# 🎧 DJ SCREWDRIVER COOKBOOK

A guide to making your tracks hit harder, mix smoother, and sound unique. No computer science degree required!

## 🎵 How Sound Gets Transformed

Think of your track like clay - each effect molds it in a different way:
- **Pitch** works like vinyl speed - higher or lower
- **Time** stretches or squeezes your sound
- **Stutter** is like quickly scratching back and forth
- **Echo** adds space and depth
- **Loop** grabs a piece and repeats it
- **Chop** cuts up and rearranges your beats
- **Mash** shuffles parts around randomly

## 🎚️ Making Tracks Bang

### Adding Weight to Your Sound
```
=== Main Menu === 
e: Add an effect

Pick effect: 2 (Speed Change)
Speed multiplier? 0.8
[Track gets deeper and heavier]

Pick effect: 6 (Stutter)
How many beats? 2
Number of stutters? 4
Length? 1
Repeat? 1
[Adds punch and intensity]
```
What's happening: Slowing it down brings out the bass frequencies, then the stutter adds impact by hitting those low frequencies repeatedly.

### Making Tracks Brighter and Louder
```
Pick effect: 1 (Pitch)
Semitones? 2
[Brightens the sound]

Pick effect: 3 (Echo)
Delay time? 0.1
Number of echoes? 4
Decay? 0.9
[Creates density and perceived loudness]
```
Why it works: Raising the pitch brings out high frequencies, short echoes stack up and make it feel louder without distorting.

## 🎹 Genre Flip Recipes

### Turn Any Track into House (128 BPM)
```
1. Pick effect: 8 (BPM)
   Target BPM? 128
   [Locks to house tempo]

2. Pick effect: 4 (Loop)
   How many beats? 1
   Total length? 4
   Play every? 2
   [Creates that house groove]

3. Pick effect: 3 (Echo)
   Delay time? 0.2 
   Number of echoes? 3
   Decay? 0.7
   [Adds classic house space]
```

### Make It DnB (174 BPM)
```
1. Pick effect: 8 (BPM)
   Target BPM? 174
   [Speeds to DnB tempo]

2. Pick effect: 7 (Chop)
   Chop every? 1
   Length? 2
   Move forward? 2
   Repeat? 1
   [Creates that broken beat feel]

3. Pick effect: 6 (Stutter)
   How many beats? 2
   Number of stutters? 4
   Length? 1
   Repeat? 1
   [Adds that dnb aggression]
```

### Hip-Hop Remix (90 BPM)
```
1. Pick effect: 8 (BPM)
   Target BPM? 90
   [Sets hip-hop tempo]

2. Pick effect: 1 (Pitch)
   Semitones? -2
   [Deepens the vibe]

3. Pick effect: 4 (Loop)
   How many beats? 2
   Total length? 8
   Play every? 4
   [Creates that head-nod loop]
```

## 🎪 Effect Stacking Magic

### Build Energy
```
1. Start Simple:
   Pick effect: 4 (Loop)
   How many beats? 1
   Total length? 4
   Play every? 2
   [Creates base pattern]

2. Add Intensity:
   Pick effect: 6 (Stutter)
   How many beats? 2
   Number of stutters? 4
   Length? 1
   Repeat? 1
   [Adds excitement]

3. Create Space:
   Pick effect: 3 (Echo)
   Delay time? 0.2
   Number of echoes? 4
   Decay? 0.8
   [Makes it huge]
```
Why it works: Each effect builds on the last - loop sets the foundation, stutter adds energy, echo makes it larger than life.

### Dark and Deep Transform
```
1. Go Down:
   Pick effect: 1 (Pitch)
   Semitones? -5
   [Darkens everything]

2. Add Weight:
   Pick effect: 2 (Speed)
   Speed multiplier? 0.8
   [Makes it heavier]

3. Create Atmosphere:
   Pick effect: 3 (Echo)
   Delay time? 0.3
   Number of echoes? 6
   Decay? 0.9
   [Adds dark space]
```
The process: Lower pitch creates darkness, slower speed adds weight, long echoes create the haunting vibe.

## 🎯 Quick Problem Solvers

### Track Too Weak?
```
1. Pick effect: 6 (Stutter)
   How many beats? 2
   Number of stutters? 4
   Length? 1
   Repeat? 1
   [Adds punch]

2. Pick effect: 3 (Echo)
   Delay time? 0.1
   Number of echoes? 4
   Decay? 0.9
   [Builds density]
```

### Need More Bass?
```
1. Pick effect: 1 (Pitch)
   Semitones? -2
   [Deepens bass]

2. Pick effect: 2 (Speed)
   Speed multiplier? 0.9
   [Enhances low end]
```

### Want More Energy?
```
1. Pick effect: 7 (Chop)
   Chop every? 1
   Length? 2
   Move forward? 1
   Repeat? 2
   [Creates movement]

2. Pick effect: 4 (Loop)
   How many beats? 1
   Total length? 4
   Play every? 2
   [Builds tension]
```

## 🎼 Effect Combinations That Always Work

### Safe Combinations
```
1. Pitch → Speed → Echo
   (Changes the sound, then adds space)

2. BPM → Loop → Echo
   (Sets tempo, makes pattern, adds depth)

3. Chop → Stutter → Echo
   (Rearranges, adds impact, creates space)
```

### Risky Combinations (Avoid)
```
❌ Echo → Echo → Echo
   (Too much delay buildup)

❌ Stutter → Stutter → Stutter
   (Gets too choppy)

❌ Loop → Loop → Loop
   (Creates weird patterns)
```

## 🎹 DJ Tips

1. **Save Your Work**
   - Press 'S' after each good change
   - You can always undo with 'U' if needed

2. **Build Gradually**
   - Start with tempo/pitch
   - Add rhythmic effects
   - Finish with space/echo

3. **Monitor Your Levels**
   - Effects can stack up and get loud
   - Use your mixer's gains to control

4. **Create Versions**
   - Make different versions for your set
   - Save intro edits, outros, drops

5. **Test Your Edits**
   - Try effects at home first
   - Know how they'll react in the mix

## 🎧 Remember

- Every track reacts differently to effects
- Trust your ears - if it sounds good, it is good
- You can always undo (U) if you don't like something
- Save (S) when you've got something good
- Have fun experimenting!
