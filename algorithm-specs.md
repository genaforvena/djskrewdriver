## Core Algorithms

### BPM Detection and Matching
```python
def estimate_bpm(y, sr):
    """
    1. Create onset envelope (detect sudden amplitude changes)
    2. Find peaks in onset envelope (potential beats)
    3. Calculate tempo using peak intervals
    4. Use dynamic programming to track beats consistently
    5. Return estimated BPM as float
    """

def match_bpm(y, sr, source_bpm, target_bpm):
    """
    1. Calculate stretch ratio = target_bpm / source_bpm
    2. Time-stretch audio using librosa's algorithm:
        - Compute STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)
        - Modify frame timing while preserving phase relationships
        - Reconstruct signal using inverse STFT
    3. Return time-stretched audio
    """
```

### Pitch Shifting (p)
```python
def pitch_shift(y, sr, n_steps):
    """
    1. Perform STFT of input signal
    2. For each frame:
        - Shift frequency bins by n_steps semitones
        - Preserve phase relationships between bins
        - Apply phase correction for continuity
    3. Perform inverse STFT
    4. Return pitch-shifted audio
    
    Note: n_steps can be positive (higher pitch) or negative (lower pitch)
    """
```

### Time Stretching (t, rt)

#### Standard Time Stretch (t)
```python
def time_stretch(y, rate):
    """
    1. Compute STFT of input signal
    2. For each frame:
        - Modify frame timing by rate
        - Keep frequency content intact
        - Maintain phase coherence
    3. Perform inverse STFT
    4. Return stretched audio
    """
```

#### Resample Time Stretch (rt)
```python
def resample_time(y, sr, rate):
    """
    1. Calculate new sample rate = sr * rate
    2. Resample audio to new rate:
        - Apply anti-aliasing filter
        - Interpolate samples to new rate
    3. Resample back to original sr:
        - Apply anti-aliasing filter
        - Interpolate to original rate
    4. Return stretched audio
    
    Note: This method creates different artifacts than standard time stretch

Would you like me to:
1. Add more detailed mathematics behind the algorithms?
2. Include visualization code for debugging?
3. Add more quality preservation techniques?
4. Include performance optimization suggestions?
